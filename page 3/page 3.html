        <p>While walking toward my house I see a strange sight. From where I'm at I can not make out what is happening but I can hear it.</p> 

        <p>“I am not crazy, I saw the thing with my own eyes. Something is in those woods,” the victim screams as they desperately try to prove they are sane.</p> 

        <p>“Ma’m this is the third time that we have come here for this same story. I can get some people to scour through the forest for anything, but it might be the same result as last time,” an officer explains. “For all we know it could be a wild animal.”</p>

        <p>“It is no animal, it is something paranormal, something human but not. something not of this world. You have to believe me,” the woman pleads.</p>

        <p>As I approach I see that it is my neighbor. She is on her knees begging at the officers. I look over at the forest and wonder, what do they know? Jaki knows that there is something wrong in the forest, and so does my neighbor. I start walking toward the edge of the forest.</p>

        <p>“STOP!” the elderly woman yells, “I see it. It's right there,”</p>

        <p>she pointed at me, actually, past me at something inside. I look deeper into the forest, scouring through the dark shadows the canopy of leaves created. I steady my vision waiting to see if I can spot any movement and then I see it. A dark figure that resembles a person but it isn’t normal. Its limbs are elongated and have too many joints. Parts of the arms bending at extreme angles from each joint. I start walking backwards, and as I do it follows me mimicking my pace, walking unnaturally. As it gets closer it seems to shrink smaller and smaller and it approaches the edge, shrinking into something familiar, something once lost. Kyo. I run to embrace him, grateful that he is alive and safe.</p>

        <p>“STOP IT!” I heard the elderly women yell “THAT’S NOT YOUR FRIEND!”</p>

        <p>Already in motion I cross the edge of the forest and embrace him. His face looks sunken, he looks tried, but glad he is somewhere familiar. I led him out of the forest and towards the path. The officers jump into action and put him into one of their cars intending taking him to the hospital to get him checked out.</p> 

        <p>I look over at my neighbor who is now crying.</p>

        <p>What did she mean by that? </p>

      <p>This is Kyo.</p>
