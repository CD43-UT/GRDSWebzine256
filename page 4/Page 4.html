      <p>Peter approaches Bridget who is sitting on the couch in the living room, “How’s the party?” he asks.</p>
      <p>“Why? You wanna know if you should come?” She responds.</p>
      <p>“Uh, yeah. What do ya think?” he asks.</p>
      <p>“Either way.” she says.</p>
      <p>“Hey, do you happen to smoke at all?” Peter asks, “I have really good weed.”</p>
      <p>“The other room has a bong,” she replies.</p>
      <p>“Sick,” Peter says. </p>
      <p>Bridget gets up and walks over to the other room with the bong. Peter turns around and asks his little sister, “Do you wanna wait out here for a second?”</p>
      <p>“No,” Charlie responds.</p>
      <p>Peter pleads, “Charlie, please, just… It’ll be two minutes and then we can hang out.. You can draw.” but it isn't enough to convince her. Regardless he continues, “Please, Charlie. I’m…,” looking around the living room and open kitchen he spots a cake, “Oh, shit, look. They’re giving out chocolate cake.”</p>
      <p>“Not to everyone,” Charlie replies. </p>
      <p>“Yes to everyone. It’s a party,” Peter tells her.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know anyone,” Charlie says truthfully.</p>
      <p>“Nobody does. Just walk over and stand there and they’ll give you a piece. Hurry up. They’re gonna run out,” she looks at him with a questioning look, “Come on, Charlie,” he pleads. She complies.</p>
      <p>After convincing Charlie to leave Peter alone he follows Bridget to the room she went into, “Hey, guys. Peter has weed.”</p>
      <p>“That was your sister downstairs?” Bridget asks Peter while passing the bong.</p>  
      <p>“Yeah. Charlie.” He says slightly annoyed.</p>
      <p>Peter’s phone vibrates, but he decides to ignore it.</p>
      <p>“Is your sister hot?” some dude in the room asks, </p>
      <p>“I actually saw her drawing me last week,” Bridget mentioned.</p>
      <p>“Oh, yeah?” Peter says. </p>
      <p>“Yeah. She made me look retarded,” Bridget says coldly.</p>
      <p>“Yeah. That’s Charlie,” Peter responds plainly. Once again his phone vibrates, and still he ignores it.</p>
      <p>Later Charlie walks to the room where Peter disappeared into wheezing. She croaks out, “Peter?”</p>
      <p>In the middle of ripping the bong, Peter is surprised to see Charlie in the doorway. Coughing he asks, “Charlie. What’s Up? Are you okay?” </p>
      <p>“It’s hard to breathe,” Charlie wheezes out.</p>
      <p>“What do you mean?” Peter asks.</p>
      <p>“I think my throat’s getting bigger,” Charlie gasps for breath.</p>
      <p>Jumping up from where he was sitting Peter scoops Charlie up and leaves the party and into the car. “It’s okay, Charlie. We’re almost at the hospital, okay?” Peter says reassuringly.</p> 
      <p>In the backseat Charlie is scratching at her throat desperately trying to breathe.</p> 
      <p>Running on adrenaline and speeding to get to the hospital, Peter occasionally peers into the rearview mirror to check on Charlie knowing that all he can do to help is drive.</p> 
      <p>Still trying to soothe the discomfort of her throat closing up, she looks out the window and opens it, hoping it will help get air into her lungs. She sticks her head out of the window and tries to breathe in the rushing air.</p>
      <p>In the dark night Peter is unable to see far down the road. Speeding down the road, desperate to get to the hospital faster Peter was unable to see the deer carcass laying in the middle of the road. In order to avoid it he swerves the car to the right and goes past the white line, almost hitting the powerline pole. As he passes the pole the wheezing and coughing stops. He stops the car. Keeping his hands on the wheel and looking straight forward, he is reluctant to look in the rearview. After sitting in silence for a minute he gazes over at the mirror and he briefly sees his sister’s headless corpse hanging out of the window. Collecting himself he starts his drive back home.</p>
      <p>Pulling up to his house he exits the car and walks inside. His parents in the other room hear him come inside. He walks past the side table next to the stairs and sees his sister’s epi-pen. He looks at it briefly and heads up the stairs to his room.</p>
      <p>Annie whispers, “Okay, good. They’re home”</p>
      <p>Steve says, “Good”</p>
      <p>Unable to sleep after what had happened; Peter lays in bed staring at the ceiling.</p>
      <p>The next morning Anne tells Steve, “I’m running out for some balsam wood. Do you want anything?” she asks</p>
      <p>“I’m good, sweetheart,” Steve responds, “Drive safe.”</p>
      <p>“Okay. Back in 20,” Annie says. She opens the door and walks  toward the car. She opens the door and sees her daughter’s body. Terrified by the sight she screams a blood-curdling scream that draws the attention of Steve. He brings her inside to try and console her, but it proves impossible. She cries out. “Oh, my God! Oh, my God!” she sobs, not knowing what to do with her emotions. The shock of seeing her daughter’s corpse, why did this happen to her. Why did it have to be her daughter, and not even a week after the death of her mother.   “Oh, no. I can’t, I can’t…,” She wails. Wanting the pain to end; she screams, “I just want to die! Oh, God. It hurts too much! I just need to die!” unconsolable, she wails, her voice able to be heard in every room of the house. The gasps of breath audible between sobs and the cracks of her voice breaking as her wails persist, “Charlie! Oh, God. Oh, Charlie!”</p>
